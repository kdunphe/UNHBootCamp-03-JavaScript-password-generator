# UNHBootCamp-03-JavaScript-password-generator

**Homework Assignment #3**

Create a random password generator based on user-selected criteria powered by JavaScript code with a clean, easy to read to design.

**The password generator was created and includes:**
* A form with an input box for password length and checkboxes to select password criteria such as lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
* A clean, responsive design leveraging Bootstrap & Flexbox
* Follows semantic HTML5
* Several resources linked to help with writing the JavaScript
* Note: would like to add a copy icon & link in the future to directly copy the password
